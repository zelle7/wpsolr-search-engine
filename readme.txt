= Why another search plugin for WP / WooCommerce / Coupons / Affiliate feeds ? =
Each blog/store owner is (should) be aware that search is probaly the mot important feature for their visitors.
Because potential visitors/customers have to find the right post/product among your blog/catalog, before even starting the order funnel.

Therefore, your search must be relevant, and fast.

1) Fast

If your search is not fast, I mean below a second, your visitor will leave because he knows there are other websites and does not want to spend too much time on each one.
On the contrary, if a visitor finds quicky the product he looks for, he has achieved the first step to complete an order.
But traditional search gets slower and slower the more products/attributes/variants you get in your store.

Fortunatly, WPSOLR is powered by the world's most used search engine, Apache Solr. Apache Solr is built from the ground to perform under a large quantity of information (many millions) and simulatneous searches.

2) Relevant

A search must return results, and only relevant results.
To do so, search should be performed on all the informations available on your products: pdfs, attributes, variants, description, excerpt, shortcodes ...
And, search should be able to perform some automatic corrections (Did you mean ?), or suggestions.

WPSOLR provides many configurations settings, and can be extended with many more Apache Solr tunings.

= Search server =
- Test the plugin with a free Solr index ready-to-use included.
- OR install and setup your own FREE [Solr server](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ "Apache Solr").
- OR if you lack the skills, buy an optional ready-to-use [Solr hosting cloud subscription](http://www.gotosolr.com/en/on-demand-solr-pricing/ "Solr hosting subscription").

= Tuning =
Tune your search page and results with WPSOLR admin panels.

Search in multi-language content, with language specific stemming, stopwords, synonyms,

Boost your search with multi-media content (pdf, .xls, .doc), filters, autocompletion, suggestions, and optional hosting.

= Why Apache Solr ? =
Standard WP search is performed by SQL queries directly on the database. So do most of search plugins.
But SQL is awfully greedy in computer resources, especially when it comes to table joins and wild cards (select * where field like ‘%keyword%’), which are both heavily used by search.
And SQL can’t keep well with natural language: synonyms, language specific plurals, stop-words, …

Fortunately, performance and relevance are features built specifically in full-text search engines.
Using a search engine, you’ll be able to deliver more accurate search to your visitors, for far less computer resources, which means better for cheaper.

The purpose of this plugin is to help you setup your dear Wordpress search to your own Apache Solr server, or to a hosted Apache server.
Apache Solr is the World leading Open source full-text Search Engine. No question on that.

And now, with this plugin, you can get it for free. So, fasten your seat belt, and enjoy the trip.

= What WPSOLR can do to help my search ? =
Relevanssi, Better Search, Search Everything, are really great because they do not need other external softwares or services to work.

WPSOLR, on the other hand, requires Apache Solr, the worlds's most popular search engine on the planet, to index and search your data.

If you can manage to install Solr (or to buy a hosting Solr service), WPSOLR can really help you to:

* Search in many sites for aggregated searches

* Search in thousands or millions of posts/products

* Search in attached files (pdf, word, excel....)

* Filter results with dynamic facets

* Tweak your search in many many ways with Solr solrconfig.cml and schema.xml files (language analysers, stopwords, synonyms, stemmers ...)

Yes. Check out our <a href="http://wpsolr.com/pricing">Premium Packs</a>.

= Can you search in several sites and show results on one site ? =
Yes, there is a (Premium) multisites option in wpsolr.

You configure the sites belonging to the network search as "local", and one or several "global" sites to show results from "local" sites consolidated, while "Local" sites continue to search their own data.
